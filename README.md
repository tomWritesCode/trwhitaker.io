# TRWhitaker.io
Major project while studying at General Assembly Sydney Front-End Development Course

Website has some features in the Javascript console by logging the function whatsNext()

Notes in the Console relate to the future of the project and also plans of side projects and concepts.

Framelines.photo is to be rebuilt and is currently in a very unperformant state. 


Future plans for the Web Development of my site.

// TRWhitaker.io - rebuild with performance updates and refactoring of css to Sass. 

// Framelines.photo - complete rebuild in AMP for performance and ease of development.

// Photography website - complete new design and project for my photography business and portfolio.

// CSS framework - working on a project with Gareth Jones one of my classmates from the course to build a CSS framework.
